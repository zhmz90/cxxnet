CXXNET Examples
====
This folder contains all the code examples using cxxnet
* Contribution of examples, benchmarks is more than welcome!
* If you like to share how you use xgboost to solve your problem, send a pull request:)

List of examples
====
* [Feature Walk-through by using MNIST](MNIST)
  - This is a basic steps of cxxnet
* [Kaggle National Data Science Bowl Example](kaggle_bowl)
  - This is an example to show you how to solve a real kaggle problem by using cxxnet.
  - This example also show basic steps to using convolution neural network.
* [ImageNet Example](ImageNet)
  - This is a step by step example to show how to use cxxnet train an AlexNet for ImageNet task.
  - We also provides better reference pre-trained model with all configurations.
* [Distributed Example](multi-machine)
  - A step by step example to show how to use cxxnet to train kaggle_bowl on
    multi-machines
