#### Introduction
This page introduces the layer related configurations of cxxnet.

##### Layer Specification
All layer configurations comes into 
```bash
netconfig = start
layer[from->to] = layer_type:name
netconfig = end
```
* **from** is the from node name, 0 means input data 
* **to** is the to node name.
* **layer_type** is described below 
* _name_ is an optional, but if you need to finetune the network to other task, _name_ is a must, since it is used to indicate which layer to be copied.

##### Weight Initialization
_Fully_Connected_Layers_ and _Convolution_Layers_ require random weight initialization. We provide two initialization methods: gaussian and xaview:
```bash
random_type = gaussian
init_sigma = 0.01
```
We extra provide Xavier initialization method[1], by using the configuration
```bash
random_type = xavier
````

Global setting can be override in the layer configuration, eg
```bash
# global setting
random_type = gaussian
netconfig = start
wmat:lr  = 0.01
wmat:wd  = 0.0005
bias:wd  = 0.000
bias:lr  = 0.02
layer[0->1] = fullc:fc1
  # local setting start
  nhidden = 50
  random_type = xavier
  # local setting end 
layer[1->2] = relu
layer[2-3] = fullc
  # local setting start
  nhidden = 6
  init_sigma = 0.005
  wmat:lr = 0.1
  # local setting end
netconfig = end
```
By using this configuration, the `fc1` layer will use Xavier method to initialize, while fully connected layer without name will use Gaussian random number with `mu=0`, `sigma=0.005` to do initialization. Meanwhile fully connected layer without name will use a learning rate different with global.

#### Connection Layer

###### Flatten Layer
* **Flatten Layer** is used for flatten convolution layer. After flattening, we can use convolution output in the feed forward neural network. Namely, the shape of the output node is transformed to (batch, 1, 1, num_feature) instead of (batch, channel, width, height). Here is an example:
```bash
layer[15->16] = flatten
```

##### Split Layer
* **Split Layer** is used for one-to-multi connection. It duplicate the input node in forward pass, and accumulated the gradient from output nodes in backward pass.
```bash
layer[15->16,17] = split
```

##### Concat Layer
* **Concat Layer** is used to concatenate the last dimension (namely, _num_feature_) of the output of two nodes. It is usually used along with fully connected layer.
```bash
layer[18,19->20] = concat
```

##### Channel Concat Layer
* **Channel Concat Layer** is used to concatenate the second dimension (namely, _channel_) of the output of two nodes. It is usually used along with convolution layer.
```bash
layer[18,19->20] = ch_concat
```
=


#### Activation Layer
We provide common active layers including , _Rectified Linear_ (RELU), _Sigmoid_ , _Tanh_ and _Parametric_RELU_ (pRELU).

=
###### Rectified Linear
* The output of **Rectified Linear** is _max(0, x)_. This is the most commonly used activation function in modern deep learning method. 
```bash
layer[15->16] = relu
```

=
###### Tanh
* **Tanh** uses the _tanh_ as activation function. It transforms the input into range [-1, 1].
```bash
layer[15->16] = tanh
```

=
###### Sigmoid 
* **Sigmoid** uses the _sigmoid_ as activation function. It transforms the input into range [0, 1].
```bash
layer[15->16] = sigmoid
```

=
###### Parametric Rectified Linear
* **pRELU** is basically the implementation of [2]. In addition, we provide a parameter to add noise to the negative slope to reduce overfitting.
```bash
layer[15->16] = prelu
  random=0.5
```
* **random**[optional] denotes standard deviation of the gaussian distribution randomly added to the negative part of pRELU. In testing, this noise part is discarded.

=
##### Loss Layer
Loss layers are self-looped layer. It defines the loss function for training. 
* Common Parameters:
* grad_scale[optional]: scale the gradient generated by loss layer

=
###### Softmax
* **Softmax** Loss Layer is the implementation of multi-class softmax loss function.

= 
###### Euclidean
* **Euclidean** Loss Layer is the implementation of elementwise l2 loss function.

=
###### Elementwise Logistic
* **Elementwise Logistic** Loss Layer is the implementation of elementwise logistic loss function. It is suitable to multi-label classification problem.


=
#### Computation Layers

###### Fully Connected Layer
* **Fully Connection Layer** fully connection layer is the basic element in feed forward neural network.
```bash
layer[18->19] = fullc
  nhidden = 1024
```
* **nhidden** denotes the number of hidden units in the layer.

=
##### Convolution Layer
If built with CuDNN, the default convolution is CuDNN R2. If there is no CuDNN R2, convolution will be run on our own kernel. The configuration looks like
```bash
layer[0->1] = conv
  kernel_size = 11
  stride = 4
  nchannel = 96
  pad = 1
```
* **kernel_size** is the convolution kernel size
* **stride** is stride for convolution operation
* **nchannel** is the output channel
* **pad** is the number of pad
* **temp_col_max**[optional] is the maximum size of expanding in convolution operation. The default value is 64, means the maximum size of temp_col is 64MB. Adjusting this variable may boost speed in training especially the input size is small in the convolution network. Note that this will only take effect when not using CuDNN.

=
#### Pooling Layer
Currectly we provide three Pooling methods: _Sum Pooling_ , _Max Pooling_ and _Average Pooling_ .
All pooling layers shared same parameters: _stride_ and _kernel_size_

=
###### Sum Pooling
* **Sum Pooling** sums up the values in the pooling region as result , eg
```bash
layer[4->5] = sum_pooling
  kernel_size = 3
  stride = 2
```

###### Max Pooling
* **Max Pooling** takes the maximum value in the pooling region as result, eg
```bash
layer[4->5] = max_pooling
  kernel_size = 3
  stride = 2
```

###### Average Pooling
* **Average Pooling** averages the values in the pooling region as result , eg
```bash
layer[4->5] = avg_pooling
  kernel_size = 3
  stride = 2
```

=
#### Other Layers

###### Dropout
* Note that **Dropout** Layer is a self loop layer. You need to set _to_ equal the _from_, eg
```bash
layer[3->3] = dropout:dp
  threshold = 0.5
```
* **threshold** is the probability to drop an output.

=
###### Local Response Normalization
LRN normalizes the response of nearby kernels. Details can be found in the Alex's paper[3].

```bash
layer[3->4] = lrn
  local_size = 5
  alpha = 0.001
  beta = 0.75
  knorm = 1
``` 
* **local_size** denotes the nearby kernel size to be evaluated 
* **alpha, beta and knorm** is normalization param.

=
###### Batch Normalization Layer
BN layer is an implementation of [4]. The difference is that in testing, we only use the mini-batch statistics instead of global statistics in training data as in original paper. _It is an experimental layer that may not stable._ To use the layer, you need to set
```bash
layer[3->4] = batch_norm
``` 
There is no parameter for this layer.
